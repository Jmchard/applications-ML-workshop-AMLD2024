# Application in Machine Learning: Time Series Forecasting

This repository provides the resources for the session and accompanying hands-on exercises on **Time Series Forecasting** at the **EPFL Extension School Workshop - Applications in Machine Learning**.

**Dataset**

We use the data from the [Global Energy Forecasting Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Energy_Forecasting_Competition). We focus on the data for the year 2014 which contains 8'760 observations.

**Time Series Forecasting**

In general, we can define a forecasting problem as a supervised regression or classification task. In this repository we define this problem as a regression task and solve it using two simple and popular models: Linear Regression and Random Forest. There are a few parameters that the user can vary during the data exploration and modeling. After training the model, the user can evaluate the performance on a separate test set and compare it with a simple baseline.
