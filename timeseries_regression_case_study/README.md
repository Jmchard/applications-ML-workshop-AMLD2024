# Time Series Forecasting

This repository provides the resources for the session and accompanying hands-on exercises on **Time Series Forecasting** at the **EPFL Extension School Workshop - Applications in Machine Learning**.

**Dataset**

We use the data from the [Global Energy Forecasting Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Energy_Forecasting_Competition). We focus on the data for the year 2014 which contains 8'760 observations.

**Time Series Forecasting**

In general, we can define a forecasting problem as a supervised regression or classification task. In this repository we define this problem as a regression task and solve it using two simple and popular models: Linear Regression and Random Forest. There are a few parameters that the user can vary during the data exploration and modeling. After training the model, the user can evaluate the performance on a separate test set and compare it with a simple baseline.


## Getting started

To get started there are two options:

### Run Hands-On in the Cloud (recommended for this workshop)

The most straightforward way to run the hands-on exercise is to execute them in the cloud. Open the jupyter notebook in Google Colab to run the code interactively [![](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/epfl-exts/amld24-applications-ML-workshop/blob/main/timeseries_regression_case_study/notebook.ipynb).

You will start with setting up the Google Colab. If you want to execute a cell, make sure it is selected and then press `SHIFT`+`ENTER` or click on the `'Play'` button.

### Run Hands-On locally on your machine (if you want to run the codes later on your machine)

Follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/epfl-exts/amld24-applications-ML-workshop/blob/main/README.md) to run the hands-on locally on your machine.
