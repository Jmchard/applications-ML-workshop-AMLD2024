# Applications of Machine Learning workshop


Welcome to the Applications of Machine Learning workshop! This repository contains all resources for the workshop presented at the [Applied Machine Learning Days 2024](https://2024.appliedmldays.org/). Whether you're a student, professional, or simply curious about the field, this workshop will provide you with a solid foundation in key machine learning concepts and practical applications.


## Overview


The workshop is divided into four parts:

1. Introduction: This section provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, explaining fundamental concepts and laying the groundwork for the hands-on sessions. You can find presentation slides [here]().

2. Classification: In this part you will learn about text classification as a supervised learning problem. You will dive into the realm of natural language processing and learn how machines can be trained to analyze text data. Here is the [text classification repository](https://github.com/epfl-exts/amld24-applications-ML-workshop/tree/main/text_classification_case_study) and enjoy learning.

3. Regression: In the third part you will learn about timeseries regression as an another supervised learning problem. You will understand the significance of time dimension in data and how machine learning can be applied to timeseries forecasting. Jump into the [timeseries regression repository](https://github.com/epfl-exts/amld24-applications-ML-workshop/tree/main/timeseries_regression_case_study) and start learning.

4. Anomaly Detection: Here you will explore the intriguing field of anomaly detection, where machine learning is used to identify unusual patterns or outliers in data. Explore the [anomaly detection repository](https://github.com/epfl-exts/amld24-applications-ML-workshop/tree/main/anomaly_detection_case_study) and enjoy learning about anomaly detection as a supervised classification problem.
